# [Lethally Sound](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Uncryptical/LethallySound/)
### ***NOTE: This Sound Pack will also include support for some popular mods that are not included in Vanilla!***
### ***Any mods that have custom supported Sound Effects will always be Soft-Dependencies, so no need to install any unless you want them!***

This is a Soundpack that includes a lot of recognizable and "funny" (subjective) sounds that have gone viral on the internet at one point or another, as well as some sounds that I originally curate for this Pack.
All of these sounds span from hearing the iconic Yippee Bug, to Fortnite sound effects, and occasionally brainrot.

With the help of loaforcsSoundAPI, 
I wanted to create a Sound Pack similar to [Lethal Resonance](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/LethalResonance/LETHALRESONANCE/) without the serious aspect of it.

Additionally, all of these sounds are <ins>**FULLY customizable**</ins>, so if there is a sound you do not like from this Soundpack OR if it conflicts with another Sound mod you would prefer, you can edit sound effects via the `LethallySound.cfg` file 
and turn them off to suit your personal tastes. 

With that being said, I would <ins>***HIGHLY recommend***</ins> having your group of friends (if you have one) to use the EXACT same configuration for the best experience!
